The Parent Trap

This repository is for the information associated with our PIR sensor and Pi Camera project.  It is by no means a finished project, but is a collection of information and documents associated with our class project to control the Raspberry Pi camera from a PIR sensor.

The Publisher file is here (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45397276/Parent%20Trap.pub), and the PDF is here (https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/45397276/Parent%20Trap.pdf) so that you can edit and change the documents to your own ends.
